## 🚀 Quick Start

> No database or server to configure—this app runs in your browser.

### 💻 Run Locally (Windows PowerShell)

**PowerShell (Windows) - Recommended:**

```powershell
# From the repo root (this folder)
./start_servers_simple.ps1

# Then open http://localhost:3000
```

**Python HTTP Server:**

```bash
cd app
python -m http.server 3000
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**VS Code Live Server Extension:**

1. Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. Right-click `app/index.html` → **"Open with Live Server"**

### 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Faculty Users**: Navigate to **Faculty Dashboard** to create cases or view embedded examples
2. **Students**: Visit **Student Dashboard** to practice documentation with provided cases
3. **Demo Cases**: Two professional cases are included:
   - 🎾 **Tennis Player - Shoulder Pain** (Impingement syndrome)
   - 💻 **Office Worker - Cervical Radiculopathy** (C6 nerve root)

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you don't see the embedded cases in Faculty Dashboard:

1. Open browser developer console (F12)
2. Run: `ptStore.forceReloadCases()`
3. Refresh the page

This clears the local cache (browser storage) and reloads cases from the manifest.

Start developing immediately with no environment setup required.

## 🤖 Optional AI integration

You can configure an external AI HTTP endpoint (any provider) by setting one of:

- `window.AI_GENERATE_URL` on the page, or
- `<meta name="ai-generate-url" content="https://your-endpoint" />`, or
- Storage key `aiGenerateUrl` (settable via DevTools localStorage; read through the storage adapter)

If not configured, the app uses the built-in deterministic case generator. No external services required.

Note: No server components are required. If you need a server‑side endpoint, any HTTP service will work—just provide its URL via one of the mechanisms above.

## 📦 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

- Pushing to the `main` branch automatically deploys via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`).
- Only the `app/` directory is uploaded and served.
- `.nojekyll` disables Jekyll processing; `404.html` provides SPA fallback so deep links reload correctly.

If your Pages URL hasn’t updated yet, check Actions for the latest “Deploy to GitHub Pages” run.

## 🧪 Dev workflow quick refs

- Lint/format: npm run lint, npm run format, npm run check
- Start local server: ./start_servers_simple.ps1 (or app/start_servers_simple.ps1)
- Browser tests: open app/tests/\*.test.html while the server runs
- Debug logs: append ?debug=1 to the app URL

## 📚 Notes on Word Export

Word export relies on the global docx library. If it’s not present, the app will show an alert. To enable it, include docx via a script tag on the page you deploy this app to, or wire it into your hosting template. The app won’t fetch or bundle docx by itself.

## 🎨 Design System & Theming

The application uses a token‑driven theming system with light/dark support and semantic role mapping.

Key resources:

- Style Guide: `docs/STYLEGUIDE.md` (principles, patterns, accessible components)
- LLM Prompt Template: `docs/STYLEGUIDE_PROMPT.md` (copy/paste prompt for AI assisted UI generation)
- Curated Tokens JSON: `design-tokens.json`
- Generated Tokens Snapshot: `design-tokens.generated.json` (run script to refresh)
- Token Generation Script: `scripts/generate-design-tokens.mjs`

### Generate / Refresh Token Snapshot

```bash
node scripts/generate-design-tokens.mjs
```

This merges discovered CSS custom properties with the curated `design-tokens.json` (never overwriting curated definitions) and writes `design-tokens.generated.json`.

### Adding New Tokens

1. Add the new CSS custom property to an appropriate stylesheet (e.g., `app/css/styles.css`).
2. If it’s a semantic or brand‑level token, also add it to `design-tokens.json` with a clear hierarchical key.
3. Re-run the generation script to confirm appearance in the generated snapshot.

Dark mode tokens are defined via `html[data-theme='dark']` overrides—only deltas (changed values) belong there; never duplicate full rule sets.
